# TrustLens

**TrustLens** is a privacy-first, browser-based misinformation risk analysis system designed to help users evaluate the *credibility, reliability, and risk signals* of online text content — without tracking users or storing personal data.

TrustLens does **not** determine truth or falsehood.  
Instead, it analyzes *patterns, signals, and context* commonly associated with misinformation, manipulation, and misleading claims.

## Why TrustLens Exists

The modern internet moves faster than fact-checking.  
Users are constantly exposed to:
- Sensational headlines
- Miracle health claims
- Financial “guarantees”
- Forwarded viral messages
- Politically charged narratives
- Unverified testimonials

TrustLens helps users **pause, reflect, and assess risk** before sharing or acting on content.
