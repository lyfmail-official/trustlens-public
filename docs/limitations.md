# Known Limitations

TrustLens is intentionally constrained.

---

## Not a Fact Checker

- Cannot verify truth
- Cannot replace journalists
- Cannot confirm events

---

## Language Limitations

- Optimized for English
- Other languages may reduce accuracy

---

## Context Blindness

- Cannot fully understand sarcasm
- Cannot infer intent reliably

---

## Evolving Threats

Misinformation evolves faster than tools.
TrustLens adapts — but never claims perfection.
